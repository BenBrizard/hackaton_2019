Aharonov-Bohm effect shows that the magnetic vector potential A can have an impact on electron dynamics even though the magnetic
field is zero. Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum phenomena describing the phase shift between two paths travelled by the electron. This 
phase shift, caused by the magnetic vector potential, implies constructive or destructive interference when the two paths recombine. 

To simulate this effect, run the script "Schrodinger_prop.py". The Schrodinger equation is solved in 1D under the condition of a defined
magnetic vector potential. We tried to represent the wavepacket in 2D to illustrate the paths taken by the electron.
